# CSS to the Rescue: FIREWORK EDITION
## Asignment
The course CSS to the Rescue is about learning to create innovative, experimental, yet pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. The assignment is to create a dynamic, CSS only firework show, where the user is able to influence the show. The challenge here, is that it's not allowed to use any JavaScript!
